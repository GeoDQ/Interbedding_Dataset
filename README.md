# Interbedding_Dataset

This is a synthetic training dataset that can be used to train a U-net CNN model for mapping litho-facies from seismic data.
This dataset contains 5000 patches of geological images and 5000 patches of seismic images, each has 256*256 pixels.


Please unzip masks.zip for 5000 patches of 2D geological models of interbedded chalk and flint layers.
5000 seismic patches can be downloaded here:
